 Bookstore Project Installation Guide

1. Open the bookstore-project-main folder in Visual Studio Code
2. Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code
3. Open another terminal so that you have two terminals side-to-side (you can do this by clicking on the button in the top right of the terminal that looks like a rectangle with a vertical line through the middle)
4. In the first terminal, navigate to the frontend folder using the command "cd frontend"
5. In the second terminal, navigate to the backend folder using the command "cd backend"
6. After you have navigated to the respective folders, type "npm install" into both terminals and wait until installation is finished
7. After the installation is finished, type "npm run dev" in the frontend terminal, and "npm run start:dev" in the backend terminal
8. The frontend terminal will show you the link to the page on which the application will be running (in my case localhost:5173)
