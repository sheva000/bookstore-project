 Bookstore Project Installation Guide

 1. Install Docker Desktop if you do not already have it installed
 2. After it is finished installing, open the Docker terminal
 3. In the Docker terminal, navigate to the 'bookstore-main' folder
 4. The path should look something like this:  C:\folder1\folder2\bookstore-main> (The drive letter and folder names will vary, this is just an example)
 5. After the 4th step, write 'docker-compose.exe up -d' in the Terminal (without quotation marks)
 6. The command will start the process of pulling two containers and after they are finished they will be started
 7. When the containers are running, go to your browser and in the URL field enter 127.0.0.1:222
