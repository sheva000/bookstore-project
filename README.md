# Installation Guide
 Bookstore Project Installation Guide

1. Download the source code as a .zip file from the repository.
2. Extract the .zip file, which will create a folder named bookstore-project-main.
3. Open the bookstore-project-main folder in Visual Studio Code (VS Code).
4. Open the terminal in Visual Studio Code (you can do this by selecting View > Terminal from the menu bar).
5. Open a second terminal by clicking the button in the top-right corner of the terminal that looks like a rectangle with a vertical line (this splits the terminal into two side-by-side).
6. In the first terminal, navigate to the frontend folder by running the command: cd frontend
7. In the second terminal, navigate to the backend folder by running the command: cd backend
8. Install dependencies in both terminals by typing: npm install
9. Wait until the instalation is finished
10. To start the project: type "npm run dev" in the frontend terminal, and "npm run start:dev" in the backend terminal
11. The frontend terminal will display a link to the application (in my case http://localhost:5173). Open this link in your browser to access the Bookstore application.
